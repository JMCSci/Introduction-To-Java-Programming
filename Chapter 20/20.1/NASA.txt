NASA will provide coverage of the upcoming prelaunch and launch activities for the SpaceX Crew Dragon launch escape 
demonstration, as part of the agency’s Commercial Crew Program, which is working  with U.S. companies to launch American 
astronauts on American rockets and spacecraft from American soil. 

The test launch, as well as other activities leading up to the test, will air on NASA Television and the agency’s website.

The spacecraft is planned to land under parachutes offshore in the ocean.
